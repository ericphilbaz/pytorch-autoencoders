# What's this
Implementation of some autoencoder models in PyTorch.

I wrote this packages just for personal usage(=RL research), but I think it's reusable.

# Models
- AutoEncoder
- Variational Auto Encoder
  - introduced in https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114
- Î²-VAE
  - introduced in https://openreview.net/forum?id=Sy2fzU9gl
  - model is same as VAE, only loss function is different
